            <h3>The special operations community has an ethics problem. While forward, operators frequently encounter lose / lose situations that the community isn't preparing them to solve.  This increases the risk of mission failure and damage to the reputation of the SOCOM community as a whole.  In part, the problem stems from the difficulty of the situations themselves, but the problem is aggravated by the community's treatment of ethics training as an individual task, when it isn’t.  Ethics training is a collective task, and it requires as much training as any other special operations skill set. 
                Grey Zone Ethics provides solutions to that problem.</h3>

To that point, we offer instructor moderated scenario training to prepare personnel to deal with the ethical difficulties of partner nation interaction and interagency engagement.  This training provides leaders with a better understanding of how their personnel make decisions under stress and provides personnel with a better grasp on their own strengths and weaknesses under pressure.</div>

We can provide tailored integration of ethics training into your existing exercises and training events, or with our partners at F3EA, we can build highly challenging, realistic exercises for your unit entirely.</div>
