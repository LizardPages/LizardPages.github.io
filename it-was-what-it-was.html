            <h3 class="home-text2">In 2006, a young lieutenant was assigned to a newly formed “Surge” Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division.   Over the next two years, he and his fellow soldiers built the unit from the ground up, deployed to Iraq, and fought a fifteen-month battle to stabilize a small piece of war-torn Baghdad.   Through the ups and downs of combat, these soldiers and their families learned difficult lessons in leadership, camaraderie, communication, and hardship, and in the end, they were all impacted significantly by the experience.<br><br>

                It Was What It Was is an engaging and visceral first-hand account of the strange and often contradictory difficulties of small unit leadership and family life in 21st century warfare.<br><br>

            <h2 class="title">Praise for the Book</h2>
            <h3 class="home-text2"><em>"An engrossing, compelling, often raw account of combat over 15 tough months in Baghdad during the Surge.  "It Was What It Was" captures brilliantly the timeless tale of a young leader and his soldiers on the ground seeking to find meaning and purpose in the gritty, visceral reality of war at the small unit level."</em> General David Petraeus, US Army (Ret.), former Commander of the Surge in Iraq, 

                US Central Command, and NATO/US Forces in Afghanistan, and former Director of the CIA<br><br>
                
                <em>“A terrific read and one that fills an important gap in the literature on the Surge in Iraq and the challenges faced. A brilliant demonstration of American ingenuity in the gritty real-world of war so alien to policy makers today.”</em>  Rob Ritchie, Associate Professor of History, Liberty University<br><br>
	    <em> "It Was What It Was offers a riveting and deeply personal account of violence and sacrifice experienced during the pivotal surge of forces and focus on Baghdad. As a Green Beret, Dan brings a unique and insightful viewpoint, blending gritty combat experiences, personal conversations, and sage strategic analysis. His vivid storytelling transports readers to the heart of the conflict, revealing both the challenges and triumphs faced by soldiers on the ground. "</em> Buck Elton, Major General, USAF (ret), former Commander of the Special Operations Joint Task Force - Afghanistan and former Deputy Commanding General of JSOC<br><br>

		<em>"It Was What It Was tells it like it was - better than anything else written by a ground level commander in Iraq. Dan relays the highs and lows of being a newly minted leader during the Surge. Written with equal parts humor, humility, and insight, his account should resonate for years to come. In fact, this should - nay, better - become a classic. I say that based on 20 years of assigning reading to once-and-future GWOT veterans. Anyone who served during the GWOT should be able to relate to this book, to include spouses since, as Dan makes clear, 15 months was a painfully long time for a young family like his to be separated. But actually, anyone seeking a better feel for the surreality of war in the early 21st century would do well to read It Was What It Was. The writing alone is as good as writing gets." </em>
