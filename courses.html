            <h3>Grey Zone Ethics presents a useful, operator-level guide to grappling with the special operations community’s ethics problems, but organizations that want to take their internal ethics training to the next level can coordinate for seminars, class-room ethics training, or the integration of ethical challenges into their tactical training.  We’ve provided this service to multiple special operations units, and the feedback has been universally positive.<br><br>

                Ethical problems create an invisible risk that can derail your unit’s readiness and effectiveness.  You wouldn’t skip marksmanship training; don’t skip ethics training either!  </h3>

Using examples from our 20+ years of experience dealing with ethical complexity on and off the battlefield, our seminar provides a candid look at the problems your organization is likely to face and our recommended solutions to those problems.</div>

                <div class="text2"><b>Scenario Training: </b>As recommended in our book, ethics training cannot be completely trained in the classroom – roleplaying and live scenario training are necessary.  To that point, we offer instructor moderated scenario training to prepare personnel to deal with the ethical difficulties of partner nation interaction and interagency engagement.  This training provides leaders with a better understanding of how their personnel make decisions under stress and provides personnel with a better grasp on their own strengths and weaknesses under pressure.</div>

                <div class="text2"><b>Exercise Integration: </b>Integrating ethical problems into your collective training events provides the best and most realistic ethics training available and is critical to preparing your organization to deploy.  We can provide tailored integration of ethics training into your existing exercises and training events, or with our partners at F3EA, we can build highly challenging, realistic exercises for your unit entirely.</div>
